        <p>
          For over <strong>24 years</strong>, National Rental has been proud to serve the Ottawa region, helping homeowners, event planners, and businesses bring their visions to life.  
          What began as a small family-run staging service has grown into the area’s leading rent-to-own provider, offering everything from elegant home stagings for realtors to comprehensive furniture rentals for both short-term events and long-term needs.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our professional home-staging team combines industry-leading design expertise with an extensive, ever-evolving inventory of quality furnishings.  
          Whether you’re showcasing a downtown condo or a sprawling suburban estate, we tailor every detail to highlight each property’s unique character—and help you sell faster, often at a higher price point.
        </p>

        <p>
          Beyond residential services, National Rental has become a trusted partner for festivals, corporate functions, and community events across the Ottawa area.  
          From temporary seating and décor to full exhibit-hall set-ups, we handle logistics, delivery, installation, and removal—so you can focus on creating unforgettable experiences for your guests.
        </p>

        <p>
          We understand that every client’s needs are different. That’s why we offer flexible rental terms—from a single weekend to several years—with transparent pricing and white-glove service every step of the way.  
          Our locally based support team is on call 24/7 to ensure your rental items arrive on time, in perfect condition, and are tailored to your exact specifications.
        </p>

        <p>
          At National Rental, our mission is simple: to provide Ottawa—and beyond—with the highest-quality rental solutions, backed by nearly a quarter-century of expertise and an unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction.  
          Let us help you elevate your next project, event, or home-sale staging with style, reliability, and the personal touch that only comes from 24 years of local experience.
